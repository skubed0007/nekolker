Dear Neko,

I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for having you in my life. Since the day we met on Discord and dove into the amazing world of Nekolker, it's been an incredible journey filled with laughter, support, and endless joy.

One of the things that truly warms my heart is how you wholeheartedly embrace everything I do. Whether it's sharing my latest programming project or discussing our favorite topics late into the night, your unwavering support and enthusiasm never fail to lift my spirits.

Your genuine interest in my passions and your willingness to share yours with me have created a bond that I cherish deeply. It's rare to find someone who not only appreciates your interests but also celebrates them alongside you, and for that, I am truly grateful.

Thank you for being the amazing friend that you are. Your kindness, positivity, and infectious energy brighten my days in ways I never imagined. Here's to many more adventures together, both in the virtual world of Discord and beyond.

With all my appreciation and affection,

Skub
