# Introducing Nekolker
A new FIle Encryption And Decryption Software Made In Rust By SKub And Neko!! Fast , Safe And Secure

# Neko's Overbearing Restriction (NOR)

Hey there, fellow coders and file security enthusiasts! Today, I'm thrilled to introduce you to **Neko's Overbearing Restriction (NOR)**, a cutting-edge file encryption algorithm that combines the power of XOR and AES algorithms with a sprinkle of feline charm.

## Features

Nekolker isn't your run-of-the-mill encryption software. It's packed with features designed to make file encryption both effective and enjoyable:

- **Encryption & Decryption**: With Nekolker, you can securely encrypt your important files or effortlessly decrypt them for seamless access.
  
- **Password Protection**: Safeguard your encrypted data with a password of your choice, ensuring only authorized users can access your files.
  
- **Informative Guide**: Nekolker comes with a built-in guide that provides valuable insights on potential decryption issues and best practices, ensuring you have all the information you need to keep your data safe.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Nekolker is a breeze! Here's how you can dive into the world of secure file encryption:

1. **Download from Skub's GIT**: Head over to [GIT repository](https://github.com/skubed0007) to clone or download NOR's source code. Skub and Neko is the brilliant mind behind NOR's development, and his repository is your go-to destination for all things NOR.
2. Build From Source Like You Would Build Any Other Rust Program
   
3. **Run NOR**: Once you've built NOR, fire up the program according to your system's guidelines, and you're ready to start encrypting and decrypting files with ease.
**OR**
**Download the release file from release section (only for windows and linux)**
## Using NOR

Now that you've got Nekolker up and running, let's explore how you can make the most out of its powerful features:

- **Encryption (Option 1)**: Choose this option to encrypt a file. Simply provide the file name, password, and desired output folder, and NOR will handle the rest, encrypting your file using its robust algorithm.
  
- **Decryption (Option 2)**: If you have a previously encrypted NOR file (with the .neko extension), select this option. NOR will prompt you to provide the file name, password, and desired output folder, and voila! Your file will be decrypted and ready for use.
  
- **Important Information (Option 3)**: Don't forget to explore this section, where you'll find valuable insights on potential decryption issues and essential tips for keeping your password safe.

## Thanks Neko

   Before you embark on your encryption journey with Nekolker, I want to take a moment to honor Neko, the inspiration behind this project. You can reach out to Neko via business email at [nekomusumebusiness@gmail.com](mailto:nekomusumebusiness@gmail.com). Neko's playful spirit and unwavering curiosity have infused Nekolker with a special charm that I hope you'll enjoy as much as I do.

Happy encrypting, and may NOR and Nekolker bring you peace of mind and security in your digital endeavors.

Yours in code,
Skub And Neko
