The Rust program is designed for file encryption and decryption.
It presents a command-line interface for the user to choose between encryption, decryption, or reading important information.
The encryption process involves reading a file, encrypting its contents using a password-based method, and saving the encrypted data to a new file.
Decryption follows a similar process, where the encrypted file is read, decrypted using a password, and saved to a new file.
Important information is displayed regarding potential issues with decryption and the importance of password management.
The program utilizes user input for file names, paths, and passwords, and it handles user choices using a loop and match statements.
A restart function is defined to clear the screen and start the program again.
